# ABOUT My_Cookbook

**What is this app used for?**

This cookbook app serves as a means to organize and collect different
cooking recipes into one place and manage them into a viewable, navigatable interface.

Anyone can view individual recipes via the community page, where all the recipes 
will be listed under. Each entry will contain information such as what the dish is
called, a brief description, a list of ingredients, a rating, and a step by step description
on how to cook or bake the dish.

To submit a recipe to the page, one must register a username, email, and password to create
their own account. Once their account is created, they will be able to submit their
 own personal recipes to the website.
